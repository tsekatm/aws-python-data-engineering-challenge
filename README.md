# 🛠️ AWS Python Data Engineering Challenge

Welcome to the **AWS Python Data Engineering Challenge** repo! This project demonstrates a hands-on ETL pipeline in Python using open-source tools to simulate real-world data engineering workflows.

> 🔍 Designed as a learning exercise and demonstration of core data engineering principles using Pandas, AWS tools (mocked), and best practices in Jupyter notebooks.

## 🚀 Features

- Extracts data from CSV files (simulated as AWS S3 input)
- Cleans and transforms the data using Pandas
- Validates and loads data into a local destination (simulating a data lake or Redshift)
- Demonstrates:
  - Feature engineering
  - Data validation
  - Handling missing and inconsistent data
- Designed to be modular and easy to adapt

---

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- **Python 3.11+**
- **Pandas**
- **Jupyter / Google Colab**
- Simulated AWS data flow (can be extended to real S3, Glue, or Redshift)
- CLI and filesystem-based I/O (lightweight, cloud-ready)

## 📦 Setup Instructions

### ▶️ Run on Google Colab
1. Click `Open in Colab` from the notebook in this repo.
2. Run all cells from top to bottom.
3. Modify paths if needed to use your own datasets.

### 🖥️ Run Locally
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tsekatm/aws-python-data-engineering-challenge.git
   cd aws-python-data-engineering-challenge
````

2. Install dependencies (create a virtual environment if preferred):

   ```bash
   !pip install boto3 pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn plotly scikit-learn
   ```
3. Launch Jupyter:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook etl_pipeline.ipynb
   ```

## 📊 Sample Output

* Transformed data available in `/output`
* Null checks and feature engineering logs printed inline
* Easily export results to CSV, Parquet, or database targets

---

## 🧠 Learning Objectives

By working through this notebook, you'll learn how to:

* Design a simple but extensible ETL pipeline
* Apply data cleaning and transformation best practices
* Prepare data for analytics or machine learning pipelines
* Simulate AWS workflows in a local dev environment
